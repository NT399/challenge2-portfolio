# challenge2-portfolio

## Description

This project required adding code in CSS and HTML for the purposes of creating a space to showcase projects, information about me and my contact details.

The website created utilised flexboxes, hover function, links and images. The code included the necessary specifications to ensure the layout was responsive to different screen sizes.

This project was useful in consolidating the concepts and knowledge from my learnings of HTML and advanced CSS.
